The main source code is located in the `lib` directory. The code is organized into the following directories:

- `lib/`: Contains the main widgets and entry point of the application.
- `lib/app_bar/`: Contains widgets related to the browser's app bar.
- `lib/models/`: Contains the data models for the application.
- `lib/pages/`: Contains the different pages of the application, such as the settings page and the developer tools page.

A detailed analysis of each file in the `lib` directory is available in the `GEMINI.md` file in the project root.
